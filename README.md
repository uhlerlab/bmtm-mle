# BMTM MLE

This repository contains the code to investigate the properties of MLEs for Brownian Motion Tree Models under one sample.

To install the necessary requirements in a virtual environment and activate it, run:
```
bash setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

The repository is organized as follows:
* `/algorithms` contains implementations of each algorithm.
* `/experiments` contains the code to replicate experiments.
* `/scratch` contains files with "scratch work", e.g. profiling and other testing.
